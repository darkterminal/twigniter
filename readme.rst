What is Twigniter :fireworks:
###################

Twigniter is a CodeIgniter Application Development Framework - a Boilerplate - for people
who build web sites using PHP and Twig as Template Engine. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Twigniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

Server Requirements

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
